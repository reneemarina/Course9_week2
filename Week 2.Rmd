#Introduction
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

#Submission
##First we upload the leaflet library
```{r}
library(leaflet)

##Then we create a map with a marker for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
```{r}
map <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat = 3.1412, lng=101.68653, popup = "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia")
